# Write a program that prompts the user to enter numbers, one per line,
# ending with a line containing 0, and keep a running sum of the numbers.
# Only print out the sum after all the numbers are entered
# (at least in your final version). Each time you read in a number,
# you can immediately use it for your sum,
# and then be done with the number just entered.

#Example:
# Enter a number to sum, or 0 to indicate you are finished: 4
# Enter a number to sum, or 0 to indicate you are finished: 5
# Enter a number to sum, or 0 to indicate you are finished: 2
# Enter a number to sum, or 0 to indicate you are finished: 10
# Enter a number to sum, or 0 to indicate you are finished: 0
#The sum of your numbers is: 21

loop = 0
x = 1
sum = 0

while loop < 5 and x != 0:
    x = int(raw_input("Input a number or 0 when finished"))
    loop = loop + 1
    sum = sum + x
print "The sum of your numbers is " + str( sum) + "!"
